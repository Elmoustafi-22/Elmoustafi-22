Beyond writing clean, elegant code, I'm driven by **purpose**—creating digital solutions that serve humanity, support ethical institutions, enhance educational experiences, and help companies achieve sustainable growth. Every project I work on is guided by one question: *"How can this make someone's life better?"*
